# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
Step 1:
we have to intialise program using import numpy to perform mathematical calculation

Step 2:
THe input from the user is stored in the variable a

Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.

Step 4:
end of the program
## Program:
```
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: Manikandan R
#RegisterNumber:23004754
import numpy as np
a=[[3,2,5],[1,1,2],[3,3,6]]
c=np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(c)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
